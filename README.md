# First JS Practice

## Task 1
1. We believe you've reached 26-th lesson on hexlet - make sure you have.
2. Open __first-task.js__. It's in a __bin__ folder
3. Add the following string in the beginning of your first-task file:  __#!/usr/bin/env__. This will help your computer to run the code. 
4. You'll see some logs into the console: read them carefully and fill the gaps. Get some information by net surfing.
5. Create a Makefile and imagine an alias to run __first-task.js__. Call it, let's say, firstTask. By the result, you have to see an alias command that will run __first-task.js__
6. Run __first-task.js__ by your new alias via __Makefile__! Bro, just type your Makefile alias in Terminal aka CLI being in a correct folder
